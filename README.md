# ðŸ›µ Online Food Orders - Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes data collected from an online food ordering platform. It aims to explore how demographic and geographic factors influence customer behavior, as well as analyze customer feedback and order patterns using data visualizations and summary statistics.

#  ðŸ“¦ Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following types of information:

# Demographic Information
- `Age`: Age of the customer
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer
- `Marital Status`: Marital status of the customer
